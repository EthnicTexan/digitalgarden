# Welcome To Ethnic Texan!
---
Join us as we explore the genealogies and history of Texas! 

##### A Quick Note on Names 
To help you navigate our family history, we use a specific naming style:
1. **Daily Names:** If you see a name in (parentheses), that’s what the person usually went by.
2. **Avoiding Confusion:** We use the Spanish tradition of **"Father’s Surname-Mother’s Surname."** This helps us keep everyone’s branches clear and ensures that persons with the same name don't get mixed up.
