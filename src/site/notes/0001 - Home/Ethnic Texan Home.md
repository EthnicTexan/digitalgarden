# Help Preserve Our History

Family history is a collaborative effort, and I would love to hear from you. Whether you have a cherished family photo, a story passed down through generations, or have spotted a date that needs correcting, your input helps this tree grow.

**How to contribute:** Please send your stories, photos, or feedback to: **EthnicTexan@gmail.com**

> **A quick note:** This site is a solo passion project. I personally review every email I receive, but it may take me a little time to respond. Thank you for your patience!
