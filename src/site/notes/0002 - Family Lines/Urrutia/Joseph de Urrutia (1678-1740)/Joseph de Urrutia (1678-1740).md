## 1692 - UNK - UNK - Expedition

### **Genealogical Timeline: Military Service (1692)**

- **August 1692: First Apache Campaign** While stationed at the Neches River garrison as a young soldier, Urrutia participates in a joint military expedition with the **"Texas" (Hasinai)** Indians. The group marches westward into Apache territory.
    
- **The Night Ambush:** During the expedition, the company is surprised by a night attack while sleeping. According to Father Francisco Hidalgo, the group is saved from total destruction only by the **firearms** of the Spanish soldiers, including Urrutia. This marks one of Urrutia's earliest recorded encounters with the Apache nation.
    
- **c. late 1692: Major Military Victory** Urrutia continues to serve in Spanish-Indian coalition forces. In a subsequent campaign during this period, the alliance achieves a decisive victory, reportedly **killing 136 Apaches**.

- **Significance:** These early successes establish Urrutia’s reputation as a capable warrior among the local tribes, laying the groundwork for his later appointment as their "Captain General" during his seven-year stay (1693–1700).

## 1693 - UNK - UNK - Expedition

- **Arrival and Abandonment:** Urrutia was a young soldier stationed at a Spanish garrison near the **Neches River** during the Terán expedition.
    
- **The 1693 Departure:** When Spanish forces withdrew from the area in 1693, Urrutia did not return with them. He remained in East Texas as one of only four soldiers left behind.

- He suffered an **accident on the Colorado River** which forced him to stay among the Indigenous populations.

- **Integration and Leadership:** He lived among the **Kanohatinos, Tohos, and Xarames** for seven years. During this time, he rose to the rank of **"Captain General"** for a confederation of tribes.
    
- **Military Campaigns:** Utilizing his Spanish military background, he led these nations in several extensive and successful campaigns against their common enemy, the **Apaches**.

## 1694 - UNK - UNK - Expedition

- 1694: Conflicting Accounts of the "Desertion"
    
    Evidence from the writings of Father Damián Massanet suggests that after the Spanish withdrawal in 1693, Urrutia and other soldiers may have returned to the abandoned missions. A "faithful Indian" reported to the Padres that the deserters had gone back to help local tribes recover buried mission supplies and tools.
    
- 1694–1700: Life Among the Cantona Tribes
    
    While it was previously believed Urrutia lived with the "Texas" (Hasinai) tribes, historian Herbert E. Bolton clarifies that he actually lived among the Cantona Indians near the lower Colorado (San Marcos) River.
    
    - **The Tribes:** He integrated specifically with the **Cantujuanas, Toos, and Yemes** (also recorded as Kanohatinos, Tohos, and Xarames).
        
    - **Cultural Mastery:** During these seven years, he became intimately acquainted with their customs and mastered their various languages, knowledge that would later make him the Spanish government’s most valuable asset in the region.
        
- c. 1695–1700: Rise to "Captain General"
    
    Urrutia’s Spanish military training led to his appointment as the "Captain General" of a massive alliance of tribes located east of the middle Colorado River.
    
    - **Commanding the Coalition:** He claimed to have led joint campaigns involving as many as **10,000 to 12,000 warriors**.
        
    - **The Apache Conflict:** He served as the primary strategist for these allied nations in their "inveterate" (long-standing) war against the **Apaches**, their common enemy.

- **Documented Lineage:** The 1739 record specifically identifies **Pedro de Urrutia** as the legitimate son of the Captain and **Rosa Flores de Baldés**, confirming the second marriage and the family's status in the San Antonio presidio.
