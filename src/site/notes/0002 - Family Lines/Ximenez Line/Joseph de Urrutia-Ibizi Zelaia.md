# Clarification 

### Joseph Antonio Fernández de Jáuregui Urrutia
* [[0002 - Family Lines/Ximenez Line/Joseph de Urrutia-Ibizi Zelaia\|Joseph de Urrutia-Ibizi Zelaia]] should not be confused with [[Joseph Antonio Fernández de Jáuregui Urrutia\|Joseph Antonio Fernández de Jáuregui Urrutia]]
* [[Joseph Antonio Fernández de Jáuregui Urrutia\|Joseph Antonio Fernández de Jáuregui Urrutia]] was Governor of Nuevo León (1732-1741)
* [[0002 - Family Lines/Ximenez Line/Joseph de Urrutia-Ibizi Zelaia\|Joseph de Urrutia-Ibizi Zelaia]] was captain of San Antonio de Béxar Presidio (1733-1740)
* There are documents in the [[Bexar Archives\|Bexar Archives]] that have an overlap of both these men, and can create confusion as to which on is which. It appears that in the Bexar Archives **The Governor of Nuevo Leon** is mention as *Jáuregui y Urrutia* which is an easy way I have so far found to distinguish between these two men. 
* Here is quick recap of [[Joseph Antonio Fernández de Jáuregui Urrutia\|Joseph Antonio Fernández de Jáuregui Urrutia]]  Life Story to provide more proof of how he is not the same person as [[0002 - Family Lines/Ximenez Line/Joseph de Urrutia-Ibizi Zelaia\|Joseph de Urrutia-Ibizi Zelaia]]

**Fernandez de Jauregui Urrutia, Joseph Antonio (unknown–unknown).** 

From 1732 to 1741 Joseph Antonio Fernández de Jáuregui Urrutia served as governor of Nuevo León. In 1735 he wrote a report to the viceroy on conditions in his province. The document focused on the need to curb the hostile natives who inhabited the adjacent coastal region later incorporated into the province of [Nuevo Santander](https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/nuevo-santander). Although Fernández failed to offer a comprehensive plan for conquering the coastal strip, his report initiated a series of efforts to solve problems stemming from the region's hostile natives. When the viceroy failed to respond, Fernández forwarded his report with a map and supporting documents to the Crown, but King Felipe V took little notice. On July 11, 1737, the Nuevo León governor was given an additional assignment as governor extraordinary and _visitador_ of Texas; he was to investigate the administration of ousted Texas governor [Carlos Benites Franquis de Lugo](https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/franquis-de-lugo-carlos-benites). Not until 1738 was he able to renew his appeal on behalf of Nuevo León settlers. In the meantime, other plans, largely self-serving, emerged, leading ultimately to the choice of [José de Escandón](https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/escandon-jose-de) to subdue and colonize the Costa del Seno Mexicano (Gulf of Mexico Coast). Upon completion of the Franquis investigation, Fernández returned to Monterrey to serve out his term as Nuevo León governor. [Prudencio de Orobio y Basterra](https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/orobio-y-basterra-prudencio-de) was named governor _ad interim_ of Texas.

### TEXAS HANDBOOK LIFE STORY 

```markdown 
**Source:** https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/urrutia-jose-de
```

```
**Urrutia, José de (ca. 1678–1741).**José (Joseph, Josef) de Urrutia was born in Guipúzcoa, Spain, about 1678. He came to America before 1691, when, as a member of the [Domingo Terán de los Ríos](https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/teran-de-los-rios-domingo) expedition, he was left at the garrison established near the Neches River. When the soldiers withdrew in 1693, Urrutia met with an accident on the Colorado River and was forced to remain among the Indians. He was one of four soldiers who remained in East Texas at this time. He lived with the Kanohatinos, Tohos, and Xarames for seven years, was made "captain general" of all the nations hostile to the Apaches, and conducted several extensive campaigns against the Apaches. He rejoined his countrymen shortly after the founding of San Juan Bautista Mission in 1700. By July 23, 1733, when Urrutia was made captain of San Antonio de Béxar Presidio, he had forty years' experience with the Indians in Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Texas and was probably the best informed of all Spaniards on Indian affairs in Texas. In the winter of 1739 he led a campaign against the Apaches in the San Saba region; he apparently reached the same point that [Juan Antonio Bustillo y Ceballos](https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/bustillo-y-ceballos-juan-antonio) had reached in his Apache campaign of 1732. Urrutia's first wife was Antonia Ramón; they had one daughter, Antonia, who married Joseph Antonio Menchaca (also known as Franscisco Menchaca). Urrutia later married Rosa Flores y Valdez; they had four daughters and six sons, including [Toribio de Urrutia](https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/urrutia-toribio-de), who succeeded him as captain of the Bexar presidio. Urrutia died on July 16, 1741.

Joseph de Urrutia, the romantic character who accompanied the Terán Expedition of 1691, was born in Guipúscoa, that aristocratic province of Old Spain, the refuge of nobles of purest blood. “Hidalgo tells us that in August, 1692, the soldiers joined the Texas in a campaign against the Apaches, going westward until the land of the enemy was reached. While the invaders were sleeping peacefully one night the Apaches attacked them, and, says our informant, had it not been for the firearms of the Spaniards, not one of them would have returned home. On another campaign of this early period the Texas, with the aid of the Spaniards, are said to have won a great victory over the Apaches, killing 136 of their number.” Urrutia was left, a mere youth, at the garrison established near the Neches by Terán. “When the soldiers withdrew in 1693, Urrutia met with an accident on the Colorado river and was forced to remain among the Indians.” This is Urrutia’s own statement, communicated to the viceroy, May 9, 1738. Some, however, say that Joseph Urrutia, with three other soldiers, Nicolás Rodelo, Francisco González and Marcos Juan, “deserted and turned back to live with the Indians.” Castañeda adds, in Our Catholic Heritage in Texas, I, 376, citing Manzanet to the viceroy, 1694, A. G. I., Guadalajara, “At the Colorado, one of the faithful Indians of the mission overtook the fugitives and informed the Padres that the soldiers who had deserted, and gone back to the mission and helped the Indians dig up the buried articles.” According to Bolton, Urrutia was left wounded among the Cantona, Indians of the lower Colorado [San Marcos]. “Here he lived among the Cantujuanas, Toos, and Yemes for seven years (apparently not among the Texas, as has been supposed), and was made captain general of all the nations that were hostile to the Apaches, learning their languages and becoming intimately acquainted with their customs. He headed joint campaigns against the Apaches, he said, with evident exaggeration, numbering at times as many as 10,000 or 12,000 warriors.” The Apaches waged war with their inveterate foes, the Texas, all of the tribes east of the middle Colorado being allied against them.

## 1700

* "He rejoined his countrymen shortly after the founding of San Juan Bautista Mission in 1700." 
	* the timeline is a little off here. 
	* How do they know he was in Texas for 7 years? 
	* How do we know he returned after founding of San Juan Mission? 
	* On May 16, 1691, [Domingo de Teran Expedition] army departed from its base camp in Monclova and crossed the Rio Grande on May 28. So if he married in 1697 that is 6 years almost that he was in Texas.

5 Thoribio, who was appointed Captain of the Presidio of San Antonio de Béjar, after his father's administration, as a reward for the particular merits of his father, and for seven years of satisfactory service on his own part, to the Crown. 
39 

He was also Justicia Mayor in 1743. His foray in 1745, to check the Apache outrages was one of the most notable of its kind. 

Like those of Flores, 1723, Governor Bustillo, 1732 and Joseph de Urrutia, 1739, this campaign was later said to have been made to the San Sabá river. 40 

He was the signer of the Puntos del Parecer, an abridgement of the Testimnonio, signed in Mexico, July 4, 1744, by Felix de Sandoval. 

Thoribio de Urrutia married Josefa Flores Valdes. They had no posterity. 

The widow received a Royal Grant in 1778, along the San Pedro Creek, in front of where she was living, at a crossing of the creek; to the south was the home of Luis Antonio Menchaca, with the street going to the bridge between. 

Thoribio de Urrutia was very generous to his niece, [[Maria Ignacia de Urrutia]], who married [[Joseph Bueno de Rojas]]. 

During the visit of the [[Bishop of Guadalajara]], in [1759] (who gave orders for the maintenance of a proper school and school master), he solicited and obtained, according to Shea, “the privilege of erecting an altar of the *Immaculate Concepcion* in one of the transepts with the privilege of **making it a burial place for his family** on payment of four dollars at each interment, and making an offering of wax, bread, and wine on All Souls' Day.”

* His Francisco born in 1746 would be the same age as his children, if we went with his research. 
	* I know for a Fact the dates that these children were born as shown by their birth records below. So he must be using Pedro as a name also.

Fray Hidalgo returned later to live among the Asinais, where he continued his missionary work for several years, contemporary with Captain Urrutia’s stay. 

* They both so endeared themselves to the Indians in 1714, when Saint Denis appeared among them, they requested him and his party of Frenchmen, upon their arrival in Mexico to ask the appropriate authorities, to have Fray Francisco Hidalgo sent a minister to them along with other missionaries, and had an intimate knowledge of their customs and language, and to have the soldier named "Captain Urrutia" who had lived among them at the same time sent out as well.²³

In Mexico Joseph de Urrutia became known as the authority on the Indians in Texas. Upon his return, after seven years in Texas, he was appointed protector of the Indians of Nuevo León.²⁴

He enjoyed the confidence of the powerful [Marquis of San Miguel de Aguayo] who recommended that he be placed at the head of an expedition to discover the [Gran Quivira], and had he shown any enthusiasm whatever for the project, the expedition would undoubtedly have taken place.

Aguayo wrote “There lives near here [Mines of Mazapil] Don Joseph Urrutia, Guipuscano, a man of much honor, who through accident lived among the Indians seven years, and joined them in the wars against their enemies, and formed such a good opinion of them *that after an absence of nearly twenty years* he still anxiously desires to return to them, and he has so much confidence in them that I have used his services without cost to the Royal Hacienda in these mines, and in a project for the discovery of the Gran Quivira.” Urrutia said he could make the voyage to Quivira with only 10 or 12 men, confident of the good will of the many nations, his friends.²⁵

“Had the Spaniards refused to give aid to the Texas, they might have been spared, possibly, a great deal of trouble, but at the outset they had definitely put themselves on record as enemies of the Apaches, and the latter did not forget it. The Apache terror overshadows Spanish Texas from the founding of San Antonio.”

In answer to petitions from the governor for relief, the central government took some feeble measures for the greater security of San Antonio. “One of the first steps was to make Don Joseph de Urrutia captain of the presidio of Bexar, he being named because of his long experience with the Indians.

His order to take formal possession of the presidio was dated [July 23, 1733]. 

He was charged to secure the alliance of his old Indian friends and unite them against the Apaches, with the aim of making a campaign to compel them to remain quiet.” 

The garrison was increased and the governor was authoriized to levy upon presidios out-side of his jurisdiction in case of urgent need.*²⁶*

Of importance in tracing the Jumanes tribe of Indians, is Urrutia’s letter written on [July 4, 1733] in which he tells of his former campaigns with the Pelones (Lipan?) and Jumane, “who, it appears, have now in-corporated themselves in the said Apaches, which to me is very strange, because in that time (*1693-1700*), when I lived among them, they were declared enemies.”*²⁷*

By [1733] Joseph de Urrutia had had about 40 years’ experience “with Indians in Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Texas, and was probably the best informed of all the Spaniards on Indian affairs in Texas.”*²⁸*

In the career of Urrutia, as captain of Bexar, there is very little to record from [1734 to 1738], save a succession of Indian raids upon San Antonio and vicinity. 

“It is not difficult to infer from the account of these depredations and murders that the Apaches were the most pro-minent feature in the everyday life of the settlers at San Antonio. 

They had to be guarded against constantly, as is shown by one of the orders issued by the governor. 

It was to the effect that no citizen of Bexar should discharge firearms unless he should see Indians entering the place, and that a shot was to be the formal signal of an indian attack.” 

In Urrutia’s order carrying out the instructions of the governor ([[Joseph Antonio Fernández de Jáuregui Urrutia]]), it was stipulated that “If it was necessary to fire a gun for the purpose of cleaning it, license must first be obtained from the captain of the guard.”*²⁹*

“From December, 1737, until September, 1738, during the imprison-ment of Cabellos Colorados and his band, there were no depredations by Apaches at Bexar.” Chief “Red Hair” had great reputation and in-fluence among his people, and was the cause of many outrages. “It had been rumored, according to Urrutia, that this chief, before his impri-sonment, had entered into an agreement with the capitán grande of the Apache tribes to steal all of the horses belonging to the presidios of Bexar, Río Grande, Coahuila, and Sacramento, after which they would slaughter the inhabitants themselves.”*³⁰*

Governor Orobio Bazterra held an investigation concerning the part played by Cabellos in the Apache depredations, when evidence of the bad faith of the Apaches was accumulated so that the viceroy might know the condition of affairs at Bexar and provide some means of relief. But, “a short time before the investigation, Captain Urrutia

```markdown
**Urrutia, José de (ca. 1678–1741)**
José (Joseph, Josef) de Urrutia was born in Guipúzcoa, Spain, about 1678. He came to America before 1691, when, as a member of the [Domingo Terán de los Ríos](https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/teran-de-los-rios-domingo) expedition, he was left at the garrison established near the Neches River. When the soldiers withdrew in 1693, Urrutia met with an accident on the Colorado River and was forced to remain among the Indians. He was one of four soldiers who remained in East Texas at this time. He lived with the Kanohatinos, Tohos, and Xarames for seven years, was made "captain general" of all the nations hostile to the Apaches, and conducted several extensive campaigns against the Apaches. He rejoined his countrymen shortly after the founding of San Juan Bautista Mission in 1700. By July 23, 1733, when Urrutia was made captain of San Antonio de Béxar Presidio, he had forty years' experience with the Indians in Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Texas and was probably the best informed of all Spaniards on Indian affairs in Texas. In the winter of 1739 he led a campaign against the Apaches in the San Saba region; he apparently reached the same point that [Juan Antonio Bustillo y Ceballos](https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/bustillo-y-ceballos-juan-antonio) had reached in his Apache campaign of 1732. Urrutia's first wife was Antonia Ramón; they had one daughter, Antonia, who married Joseph Antonio Menchaca (also known as Franscisco Menchaca). Urrutia later married Rosa Flores y Valdez; they had four daughters and six sons, including [Toribio de Urrutia](https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/urrutia-toribio-de), who succeeded him as captain of the Bexar presidio. Urrutia died on July 16, 1741.

### Military Campaign -Source: With The Makers Of San Antonio

* In the winter of 1739 he led a campaign against the Apaches in the San Saba region; he apparently reached the same point that `[Juan Antonio Bustillo y Ceballos](https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/bustillo-y-ceballos-juan-antonio)` had reached in his Apache campaign of 1732.


```markdown 
**Source:** *With The Makers Of Texas - Chabot* 


But, “a short time before the investigation, [[Captain Urrutia]] had taken things into his own hands, and had sent in a petition to the viceroy asking permission to make a campaign against the Apaches upon his own responsibility. 

Such had been the effect of the repeated raids, he said, that the people of San Antonio, lived in a state of constant terror, and some families had already moved away. 

The inhabitants were afraid to attend to their stock, “and,” said Urrutia, their timidity does not surprise me (although I do not let them know it), for he who is not warned by the ill-fortune of others must be considered rather foolish. 

*And, thus, Most Excellent Sir, those who can enter a presidio at night as far as the center of the plaza and who without being heard can safely remove the horses from the corral in which they are tied to the doors of the houses, are to be feared.* 

As a result, the greater part of the Indians of the new conversions, fleeing from the tyranny of these barbarians, have deserted the missions in which they lived, together with their wives and children, some retiring towards[[ the coast of the Sea of the South]], a distance of more than 60 leagues, and others toward the [[Big Wood (Monte Grande)]],” or great wilds. 

Urrutia also called attention to his residence of seven years with the Indians of Texas, his knowledge of their language, and their love for him. “He is not overmodest in proclaiming his own merits, and his statements as to the necessary qualifications of a successful governor cause us to suspect that he was ‘boosting’ his own candidacy for that office. 

One of the conditions demanded by [[Urrutia]] was that he should have sole command of the expedition, without the interference of ‘other chiefs’ who might spoil the undertaking. 

The expenses of the campaign were to be met by the sale of the **captives that might be secured**, and all of the participants were to have a share in the plunder.” 

The campaign which was to begin in April was delayed until the [winter of 1739].*³¹*

### Death

* According to "The Makers of San Antonio" And "Texas Handbook Online"  Urrutia died on July 16, 1741, but this appears to be wrong as his Executor of Estate [[Joseph De Plaza\|Joseph De Plaza]]  states that he passed away on July 16, 1740. see the February Source: Bexar Archives - Briscoe Collections below for more.

Joseph de Urrutia died [July 16, 1741]; his will is dated [July 4, 1740], San Antonio.

Among his contemporaries in **San Antonio** were [[Don Juan Leal, “El Viejo”]], [[Don Juan Leal, “El Mozo”]] [[Don Diego Ramon, Lieutenant of La Bahia]], [[Joseph Maldonado, “El Chico”]] [[Don Juan Banul, “El Maestro Herrero”]] (the master smith), [Andres Hernandez, “El Mozo,]” [Joseph Maldonado, “El Albañil,”] (the mason or brick layer), and [[Juan de Aguirre, “El Sabanero”]] (the cowboy, or man on horseback who takes care of the cattle on the plains).*³³*

[[Matheo Perez]] was Lieutenant, [[Juan Galván]], Alferez, and Asencio del Razo, Sargeant of Captain Urrutia’s company.*³⁴*

In the presidio at San Antonio, [[Captain Joseph de Urrutia]] **lived** in the old **Comandancia** or **Governors’ Palace**. 

As it was adjoining the **Carcel** the Captain used frequently to converse with the prisoners during the [[siesta hour]], and even invited them into his [patio], as is stated in documents in the Bexar and Nacogdoches Archives. 

It is not at all unlikely that Urrutia’s ill feelings toward [[Governor Sandoval]], who resided in San Antonio and not the Adaes, arose from the fact that the governor, outranking him, occupied for a time, the palace on the west side of the Military Plaza.³⁵

The inventory of the estate of [[Joseph de Urrutia]] mentions a ***house and lot in Saltillo***, with a detailed list of his *personal property in San Antonio*, but with **no mention of his owning a house and lot here**. 

When preparing the inventory it is stated that they proceeded to the houses that were the dwelling of the deceased *Captain Joseph de Urrutia*, where his personal property included:

* 3 English table knives.  
* 2 Silver plates with two frames.  
* 1 Silver salt cellar.  
* 2 Silver spoons.  
* 1 Embroidered chair.  
* 1 Sword with silver handle.  
* 1 Painting, three quarters, of the Adocazión de Nuestra Señora de los Dolores*³⁶*

At the time of his appointment as Captain of the presidio at Bexar, *Joseph de Urrutia* was not without domestic cares, for as he himself states in the *Expediente sobre la campaña*, “I am a poor man, burdened with years, many children, and family, without having been able to accumulate anything in so many years of service.”*³⁷*
