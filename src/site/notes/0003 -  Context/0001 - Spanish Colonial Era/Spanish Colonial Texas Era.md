# Spanish Colonial Texas Era
---



### For our purposes, this era spans from **1690 to 1750**

# 1690s
---
>**The East Texas Push (1690–1710s):** Initial missions were built in East Texas to "check" French explorers moving in from Louisiana. Most early missions failed due to disease, drought, and Indigenous resistance.

# 1700s
---


# 1710s
---
>**The San Antonio Hub (1718):** Realizing East Texas was too isolated, Spain founded **San Antonio** as a midpoint. It became the capital and the most successful Spanish settlement in Texas.

# 1720s
---
>**The Ranching Revolution:** Since the soil was often poor for large-scale farming, the settlers turned to cattle and horse ranching. This birthed the **Vaquero culture**, which eventually evolved into the **American Cowboy** tradition.

# 1730s
---
>**The Arrival of the Canary Islanders (1731)** marked the first true "civil" (non-military) settlement. Before this, Texas was mostly populated by soldiers and friars. The arrival of these families in San Antonio established the first organized municipal government (the cabildo). They weren't just passing through; they were here to build a town.
