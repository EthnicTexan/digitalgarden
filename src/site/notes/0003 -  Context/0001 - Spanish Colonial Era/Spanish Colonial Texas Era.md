# Spanish Colonial Texas Era 1690-1750
---
This era, known as the **Mission-Presidio Period**, was defined by Spain’s reactive attempt to secure Texas as a buffer zone against French Louisiana. It shifted from early failed attempts in East Texas to the establishment of San Antonio as the permanent heart of the province.
# 1690
---
> **First East Texas Missions:** Fearing French influence, Alonso de León and Father Damián Massanet establish **Mission San Francisco de los Tejas**. The **Spanish** expedition relies on the **Hasinai Caddo** for survival, whom they call "Tejas" (meaning friends).

# 1691
---

> **The First Governor:** Domingo Terán de los Ríos is appointed the first governor of Texas. He leads an expedition to East Texas to inspect the missions, but the mission system begins to strain under the weight of poor supplies and local resistance.

# 1692
---
> **The Struggle for Souls:** Missionaries try to expand deeper into Caddo territory. However, a smallpox epidemic decimates the **Native Nations** of the region, leading the Caddo to view the Spanish and their religion with deep suspicion and hostility.

# 1693
---
> **The Great Retreat:** Facing starvation and a Caddo uprising, the Spanish burn their missions and flee back to Mexico. For the next 20 years, Texas is largely ignored by Spain—a period often called the "Years of Spanish Neglect."

# 1694–1698
---

> **The Period of Silence:** Spain focuses its resources on South America and the Caribbean, leaving the Texas wilderness to the **Native Nations**. The **French-Texan** (Louisiana) traders, however, begin moving closer to the border, trading guns and tools for furs.

# 1699
---
>**The Gateway Founded:** The Spanish establish **Mission San Juan Bautista** near the Rio Grande. It becomes the "Gateway to Spanish Texas," serving as the launch point for all future expeditions into the interior.

# 1700
---
> **Mission San Francisco de Solano:** This mission is founded near the Rio Grande. It will later serve as the foundation for the most famous mission in Texas history—the Alamo.

# 1701–1708
---
> **Frontier Tensions:** While the Spanish crown is distracted by European wars, the **Apache** begin to move southward, putting pressure on both the Spanish at the Rio Grande and the **Hasinai** in East Texas.

# 1709
---
> **Naming San Antonio:** An expedition led by Father Olivares and Captain Pedro de Aguirre reaches the San Antonio River. They find a lush area populated by the **Coahuiltecan** people and name it "San Antonio de Padua."

# 1710–1713
---
> **The French Catalyst:** Father Francisco Hidalgo, obsessed with returning to East Texas, writes a secret letter to the French governor of Louisiana, asking for help with missions. This triggers a French merchant, **Louis Juchereau de St. Denis**, to head toward Texas.

# 1714
---
> **St. Denis Arrives:** St. Denis reaches San Juan Bautista. His presence alarms the Spanish, proving the French are now a real threat to the border. However, in a twist of fate, he falls in love with and marries the granddaughter of the Spanish commander.

# 1715
---
> **The Ramón Expedition:** Spain organizes a massive re-entry into Texas. St. Denis is hired—as a guide for the very Spaniards meant to keep him out—to help re-establish missions in East Texas.

# 1716
---
>**East Texas Re-occupied:** The Spanish re-establish six missions and the **Presidio Nuestra Señora de los Dolores** in East Texas. They hope to block the French, but the **Native Nations** remain primarily interested in trade, not conversion.

# 1717
---
> **The Supply Problem:** The East Texas missions are too far from the Rio Grande. The **Spanish-Texan** friars beg for a "halfway house" settlement to provide food and safety for travelers.

# 1718
---
> **The Founding of San Antonio:** Governor Martín de Alarcón establishes **Mission San Antonio de Valero** and **Presidio San Antonio de Béxar**. This creates a permanent middle point for Spanish operations.

# 1719
---
> **The Chicken War:** A French unit attacks a small Spanish mission in East Texas, scaring off the priests and capturing chickens. The "attack" causes the Spanish to panic and retreat once again to San Antonio, abandoning East Texas for a second time.

# 1720
---
> **Mission San José:** Father Antonio Margil de Jesús establishes **Mission San José y San Miguel de Aguayo** in San Antonio. It eventually becomes the "Queen of the Missions" due to its beautiful architecture and agricultural success.

# 1721
---
>**The Aguayo Expedition:** The Marqués de San Miguel de Aguayo leads a massive force to reclaim East Texas for good. He establishes **Presidio Los Adaes** (near present-day Robeline, LA), which becomes the first official capital of Texas.

# 1722
---
> **Presidio La Bahía:** Aguayo establishes a fort and mission at the site of La Salle’s old Fort St. Louis on the coast to prevent French ships from landing in Matagorda Bay.

# 1723–1726
---
> **Settlement Stabilization:** San Antonio begins to grow. The **Spanish-Texan** soldiers marry local women, and the first permanent civil families begin to farm the land.

# 1727–1729
---
> **Rivera’s Inspection:** General Pedro de Rivera inspects the frontier. To save money, he recommends closing several East Texas missions and reducing the number of soldiers, a move that leaves the settlers vulnerable to the **Apache**.

# 1730
---
> **The Move to San Antonio:** Three of the struggling East Texas missions are relocated to San Antonio. They are renamed **Concepción**, **San Juan Capistrano**, and **San Francisco de la Espada**.

# 1731
---
>**The Canary Islanders:** Fifty-five colonists from the Canary Islands arrive in San Antonio. They establish the first civil government in Texas and name their town **San Fernando de Béxar**. Friction begins immediately between these new settlers and the established **Spanish-Texan** mission friars.

# 1732–1740
---
> **Apache Wars:** As Spanish settlement expands, the **Apache** launch a series of devastating raids on San Antonio. The Spanish are forced to engage in a "war of attrition," as the missions become fortified refuges.

# 1741–1745
---
> **Ranching Roots:** With farming difficult due to raids, the missions and settlers turn to cattle ranching. The first massive cattle herds—the ancestors of the Longhorn—begin to roam the brush country south of San Antonio.

# 1746–1748
---
>**Escandón’s Colony:** José de Escandón begins the colonizing of **Nuevo Santander** (South Texas/Northern Mexico). He establishes dozens of towns along the Rio Grande, including Revilla and Camargo.

# 1749
---
> **La Bahía Moves to Goliad:** The coastal mission and presidio are moved to a more defensible location on the San Antonio River (present-day Goliad). This becomes a key military post for the **Spanish-Texan** defense of the coast.
