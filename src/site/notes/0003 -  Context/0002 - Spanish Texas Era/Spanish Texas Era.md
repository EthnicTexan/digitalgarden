# Spanish Texas Era 1750 to 1821
---
This phase of the **Spanish Colonial Era (1750–1821)** marks the transition from a mission-focused frontier to a ranching-based society. It was a time of massive geopolitical shifts, including the rise of the **Comanche Empire**, the loss and regain of the Louisiana territory, and the violent birth of Mexican independence.

---
> **Expansion and Friction:** **Spanish-Texan** settlers continue to push into the San Saba River area. However, the **Comanche** begin moving into the region from the north, viewing the Spanish and their **Apache** allies as intruders.
