# Spanish Texas Era
---

By the mid-1700s, a generation of people had been born in Texas who had never seen Spain or even the interior of Mexico. They began to refer to themselves as Tejanos (Texans). They developed a unique ranching culture (vaquero traditions) and legal systems that were adapted to the harsh Texas frontier, distinct from the more rigid hierarchies of Mexico City.

The "Brush Country" of South Texas was the perfect incubator for this culture because thousands of Spanish cattle (the ancestors of the **Texas Longhorn**) roamed wild there. Vaqueros were the only ones with the skills to navigate the thick thorny brush, catch these wild cattle, and drive them to markets—a practice that peaked during the famous cattle drives after the Civil War.

# 1750s
---
 >**1750s–1780s:** Private land grants allowed for the rise of massive ranches in South Texas. By this time, the vaquero identity was fully formed: a distinct class of skilled, mounted herdsmen who were often of Mestizo (mixed Spanish and Indigenous) or Indigenous descent.


# 1760s
---
>**French Rivalry:** The border between Spanish Texas and French Louisiana remained a "contested ground" until France ceded Louisiana to Spain in 1762.


# 1770s

# 1780s

# 1790s
---
>As the missions began to decline and "secularize" (turning mission lands over to individuals), the identity shifted from a religious project to a community of vecinos (citizens/landowners). By the time the 19th century began, the Texan elite—families like the Seguíns and Navarros—saw themselves as a distinct political and social group with interests often separate from the Spanish Crown.



# 1800s
---
>By 1800, Texan residents were a rooted, multi-generational population with a culture that blended European, Indigenous, and frontier influences.


# 1810s
---
> **The Mexican War of Independence:** Starting in 1810, Mexico fought to break away from Spain. Texas became a chaotic battleground for revolutionaries and filibusters (illegal adventurers from the U.S.).


# 1820
---
>**Depopulation:** By 1821, after years of war and raids, the Spanish population in Texas had dwindled to only a few thousand people, mostly centered in San Antonio and La Bahía (Goliad).


# 1821
---
> **Legacy:** Even though the population was small, Spain left an indelible mark on Texas: the Spanish language, the legal system (including community property laws), architectural styles, and the name "Texas" itself (derived from the Caddo word _Tejas_).
