# Mexican Texas Era 1821-1836

---

The era from **1821 to 1836** is known as the **Mexican National Era** and the **Texas Revolution**. It is arguably the most transformative 15 years in Texas history, shifting the region from a sparsely populated Spanish province to an independent republic.

> **The Three Perspectives of the Era:**
> 
> - **Anglos:** Seeking economic opportunity and land through the Empresario system.
>     
> - **Tejanos:** Established Spanish-descent families (like the Seguíns) who acted as political bridges and pioneered the ranching industry.
>     
> - **Native Nations:** Powerful groups like the Comanche and Cherokee who navigated complex diplomacy to protect their sovereign territories.

# 1821
---

> **The Empresario System:** After Mexico wins independence from Spain, Erasmo Seguín (a prominent Tejano) escorts Stephen F. Austin to San Antonio to secure his father’s land grant. The goal is to buffer against Indigenous raids and U.S. expansion.
> 
> - **The Deal:** Settlers receive cheap land in exchange for becoming Mexican citizens, obeying Mexican laws, learning Spanish, and converting to Catholicism.
>     

# 1822
---

> **Imperial Colonization Law:** Austin travels to Mexico City to re-verify his grant. Meanwhile, the **Karankawa** along the coast begin to resist Anglo encroachment on their ancestral hunting grounds, leading to the first of many violent skirmishes with the new settlers.

# 1823
---

> **Old Three Hundred Arrival:** Austin’s first settlers arrive. To protect them, Austin organizes a militia and begins a "war of extermination" against the Karankawa, forcing many to flee their coastal homes.

# 1824
---

> **The Constitution of 1824:** Mexico adopts a federalist constitution. Texas is joined with Coahuila to form **Coahuila y Tejas**. Tejano leaders like José Antonio Navarro begin representing Texas interests in the state legislature, often advocating for the Anglo settlers' economic needs.


# 1825
---

> **State Colonization Law:** New land grants are opened. Chief Bowl (Duwali) of the Cherokee begins official negotiations with the Mexican government to secure legal titles for his people in East Texas, who had migrated there to escape U.S. expansion.

# 1826
---

> **The Fredonian Rebellion:** Haden Edwards declares independence in Nacogdoches. Texans and Cherokees both choose to support the Mexican government, helping Austin's militia suppress the revolt to prove their loyalty and protect their own land interests.

# 1827
---

> **Constitution of Coahuila y Tejas:** The state constitution is approved. It includes Article 13, banning the further introduction of slaves. Settlers begin using "99-year indentured servant" contracts to bypass the law, a practice the Mexican government views with growing skepticism.


# 1828
---

> **The Mier y Terán Report:** General Terán tours Texas. He notes that the Comanche empire (Comanchería) effectively controls the West through a massive horse-trade network, and warns that the Anglo influence in the East is becoming so dominant that Mexico is "losing" Texas.

# 1829
---

> **The Guerrero Decree:** President Guerrero abolishes slavery. While Austin secures a temporary exemption, the decree drives a wedge between the Anglo-Texans and the Centralist government. Meanwhile, the Lipan Apache seek closer ties with San Antonio Texans for protection against Comanche raids.

# 1830
---

> **The Law of April 6, 1830:** Alarmed by Terán’s report, Mexico bans further U.S. immigration and places taxes on imports. This law infuriates both Anglos and Texan merchants who rely on trade with New Orleans.

# 1831
---

> **Customs Duties and Friction:** Friction peaks at Anahuac. Local Texan officials find themselves caught in the middle—trying to enforce Mexican law while living and working alongside the angry Anglo colonists.

# 1832
---

> **Turtle Bayou Resolutions:** After a skirmish at Anahuac, Anglo settlers pledge loyalty to Santa Anna (then a "Federalist" hero). Native groups like the Caddo begin to feel the pressure as Anglo settlements push further north into their traditional trade routes.



# 1833
---

> **The Convention of 1833:** Settlers draft a state constitution. Stephen F. Austin takes the proposal to Mexico City. While there, he observes the rise of "Centralism," which threatens the local power held by Texan families in San Antonio.

# 1834

---

> **Austin’s Imprisonment:** Austin is jailed in Mexico City. Santa Anna seizes total power as a dictator. Texan leaders like Juan Seguín begin organizing local "Committees of Safety," realizing that a conflict with the Centralist government is now inevitable.

# 1835
---

> **The Spark:** The "Come and Take It" battle occurs at Gonzales. Juan Seguín forms a Spanish-Texan company to join the revolution. Sam Houston meets with Cherokee leaders, promising them land titles in exchange for neutrality during the coming war.

# 1836
---

> **Independence and Victory:** On March 2, the Texas Declaration of Independence is signed at Washington-on-the-Brazos; notable signers include **Anglo-Texan** leaders like George Childress and **Spanish-Texan** patriots like José Antonio Navarro and Francisco Ruiz.
> 
> - **The Alamo:** A diverse group of defenders—including **Anglo-Texans** like William B. Travis and David Crockett, and at least nine **Spanish-Texan** like Gregorio Esparza—die defending the mission against Santa Anna’s Centralist army.
>     
> - **The Goliad Massacre:** Following the Battle of Coleto Creek, nearly 400 **Anglo-Texan** volunteers under James Fannin are executed by Mexican forces, fueling the cry of "Remember Goliad!"
>     
> - **San Jacinto:** On April 21, Sam Houston’s army, composed of **Anglo-Texan** volunteers and Juan Seguín’s **Spanish-Texan** unit, defeats Santa Anna in 18 minutes.
>     
> - **The Result:** The Republic is born. However, while **Anglo-Texan** political dominance is secured, the **Cherokee** and **Spanish-Texans** soon find their contributions ignored as a massive new wave of American immigrants begins to claim their land.
>
