# 1836
---
> **The Birth of the Republic:** After the victory at San Jacinto, Sam Houston is elected President. While Anglo-Texans celebrate the new constitution, Spanish-Texans begin to face harassment from new arrivals. Houston signs a treaty with the Cherokee, promising them land titles in East Texas for their neutrality during the war.


# 1837
---
>**Diplomatic Recognition:** The United States recognizes Texas. Anglo-Texan land speculators flood the state, often disregarding the existing land grants of Spanish-Texan families. The Comanche maintain a wary peace, trading with the new Republic but firmly controlling the western frontier.

# 1838
---
>**The Lamar Transition:** Mirabeau B. Lamar is elected President, bringing a "Texas First" philosophy. He immediately suspends Houston’s peace policies. The Córdova Rebellion breaks out near Nacogdoches—a localized uprising of Spanish-Texans, local Native groups, and Mexican agents—fueling Anglo-Texan distrust of their Spanish-speaking neighbors.


# 1839
---
> **Expulsion of the Cherokee:** President Lamar declares war on the Cherokee, claiming they were involved in the Córdova Rebellion. In the Battle of the Neches, the Cherokee are forcibly driven out of Texas into Indian Territory (Oklahoma). Chief Bowl is killed, and his people lose their homes, leaving East Texas open for Anglo-Texan expansion.



# 1840
---
> **The Council House Fight:** A peace meeting in San Antonio between Anglo-Texan officials and Comanche leaders turns into a massacre. In retaliation, the Comanche launch the Great Raid of 1840, the largest of its kind, burning the towns of Victoria and Linnville. Spanish-Texan ranchers in the path of the raid suffer massive livestock losses.


# 1841
---
> **The Santa Fe Expedition:** Lamar sends a military and trading expedition to claim New Mexico for Texas. It is a total disaster; the group is captured by Mexican forces. The failure leaves the Republic in even deeper debt, and many Anglo-Texans begin to doubt Lamar's vision of an "Empire of the West."


# 1842
---
> **Mexican Invasions and the Archive War:** Mexican General Rafael Vásquez briefly captures San Antonio. Spanish-Texans are caught in a "no-man's land," suspected of disloyalty by Anglo-Texans if they remain in the city. Later, the failed Mier Expedition leads to the "Black Bean Affair," where 17 Anglo-Texan soldiers are executed by Mexico.


# 1843
---
> **Peace and Frugality:** Returning to the presidency, Sam Houston re-establishes peace talks with the Comanche and Caddo at the Tehuacana Creek Council. To save the Republic from bankruptcy, he drastically cuts the size of the military and the salaries of government officials.


# 1844
---
**The Annexation Debate:** In the U.S., the election of James K. Polk makes the annexation of Texas a primary goal of "Manifest Destiny." Anglo-Texans overwhelmingly support joining the Union for protection and economic stability, while many Spanish-Texans worry that statehood will further erode their ancestral land rights and political influence.

# 1845
---
> **The End of the Republic:** The U.S. Congress passes a joint resolution to annex Texas. On December 29, Texas officially becomes the 28th state. As the Republic flag is lowered, the era of independent nationhood ends, setting the stage for the Mexican-American War.
