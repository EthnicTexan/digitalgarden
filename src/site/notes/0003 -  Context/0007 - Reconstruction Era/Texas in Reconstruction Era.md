# 1865
---
> **Juneteenth and Military Rule:** On June 19, General Gordon Granger arrives in Galveston to issue General Order No. 3, announcing that all slaves are free. Provisional Governor Andrew Jackson Hamilton is appointed to begin the slow process of rebuilding the state government under federal oversight.


# 1866
---
> **The "Presidential Reconstruction" Constitution:** Texas writes a new constitution that formally abolishes slavery but refuses to grant Black Texans the right to vote or hold office. "Black Codes" are passed by the state legislature to restrict the movement and labor of the newly freed population.



# 1867
---
> **Congressional Reconstruction:** Frustrated by Southern resistance, the U.S. Congress passes the Reconstruction Acts. Texas is placed under military rule as part of the Fifth Military District. General Philip Sheridan arrives to enforce the registration of Black voters and the removal of "unreconstructed" officials.


# 1868
---
> **The Constitutional Convention:** Delegates meet in Austin to draft a new state constitution. The convention is dominated by **"Radical Republicans"** and includes ten African American delegates—the first time Black Texans participate directly in the state's highest level of lawmaking.


# 1869
---
> **The Rise of Edmund J. Davis:** The new Constitution of 1869 is ratified, centralizing power in the governor's office and establishing a public school system. Radical Republican Edmund J. Davis is narrowly elected Governor amidst a period of extreme political violence and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan.


# 1870
---
> **Readmission to the Union:** Texas is officially readmitted to the United States on March 30 after the state legislature ratifies the 14th and 15th Amendments. For the first time, African Americans from Texas are elected to the state legislature and the U.S. Congress.


# 1871
---
> **The State Police and Frontier Defense:** Governor Davis establishes the State Police to combat lawlessness and the KKK. Meanwhile, General William Tecumseh Sherman visits the Texas frontier and, after narrowly escaping an ambush, authorizes a massive offensive against the Kiowa and Comanche (the Red River War).


# 1872
---
> **The Democratic Comeback:** "Redeemer" Democrats (many of whom were former Confederates) win back control of the state legislature. They begin a systematic effort to dismantle Governor Davis’s centralized government and the progressive reforms of the Radical Republicans.


# 1873
---
> **The Disputed Election:** Democrat Richard Coke defeats Edmund J. Davis for governor by a landslide. Davis, claiming the election was illegal, barricades himself in the ground floor of the Capitol with the State Police, while Coke’s supporters (the "Travis Guard") occupy the second floor.



# 1874
---
> **The End of Reconstruction:** After President Grant refuses to send federal troops to support him, Davis steps down, marking the end of Republican rule in Texas for over a century. The "Redeemers" take full control, leading to the creation of a new, highly restrictive state constitution in 1876.
