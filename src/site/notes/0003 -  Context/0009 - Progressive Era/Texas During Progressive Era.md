# Texas During The Progressive Era 1901-1929
---
The period from **1901 to 1929** saw Texas transform from a rural, agricultural society into an emerging industrial power. Driven by the "Black Gold" of the oil boom and the social reforms of the Progressive Era, the state began to modernize even as it grappled with internal political conflicts.
# 1901
---
> **The Age of Oil Begins:** The Spindletop gusher near Beaumont produces more oil in one day than the rest of the world combined. This transforms the Texas economy from agrarian to industrial, shifting the center of power toward **Anglo-Texan** oil magnates in East Texas.


# 1902
---
> **The Poll Tax:** Texas adopts a poll tax. This serves to disenfranchise many poor **Anglo-Texans**, Black Texans, and **Spanish-Texans**, ensuring that the state's political direction is controlled by the wealthy, white Democratic establishment.

# 1903
---
> **The Terrell Election Law:** This law establishes the primary system but also allows for "White Primaries." This legally excludes Black Texans and many **Spanish-Texans** from the only elections that mattered in a one-party state.


# 1904
---
> **The Houston Ship Channel:** Construction begins to turn Houston into a deep-water port. This massive project, funded by **Anglo-Texan** business leaders, eventually makes Houston the energy capital of the world.


# 1905

# 1907
---
> **Department of Agriculture Created:** Texas establishes this department to help farmers. Even as oil grows, the state remains a global leader in cotton, with many **Anglo-Texan** and **Spanish-Texan** families tied to the "crop-lien" debt system.


# 1908
---
> **The Great Dallas Flood:** The Trinity River devastates Dallas. In response, **Anglo-Texan** city leaders begin a massive engineering project to redirect the river, demonstrating the Progressive Era belief in "mastering nature" through technology.


# 1909
---
> **The El Paso Summit:** American President Taft and Mexican President Díaz meet in El Paso. The summit underscores the strategic importance of the border, where **Spanish-Texan** communities act as the primary cultural and economic bridge between the two nations.


# 1910
---
> **The Mexican Revolution Begins:** Violence across the border causes a massive wave of refugees to enter Texas. This influx of people creates a labor boom but also triggers a "nativist" backlash among some **Anglo-Texans** in South Texas.


# 1911
---
> **Revolution in El Paso:** Thousands of people watch from rooftops in El Paso as the Battle of Juárez unfolds across the river, marking the first major victory for the Mexican revolutionaries. The conflict brings a heavy military presence to the border, disrupting the traditional cross-border lives of many **Spanish-Texan** families.


# 1912

# 1915
---
> **The Plan de San Diego:** A revolutionary plot is discovered calling for an uprising to reclaim Texas for Mexico. It leads to a "reign of terror" by the Texas Rangers, resulting in the extrajudicial killing of hundreds of innocent **Spanish-Texans**.


# 1916
---
> **The Pershing Expedition:** Following Pancho Villa's raid, the U.S. Army uses Texas as a staging ground for an invasion of Mexico. This period sees the militarization of the border, forever changing the social landscape for **Spanish-Texan** residents.


# 1917
---
> **The Zimmerman Telegram & WWI:** A German plot to return Texas to Mexico is exposed, pushing the U.S. into WWI. Thousands of **Anglo-Texans** and **Spanish-Texans** enlist, while the state becomes the nation's primary military training ground.


# 1918
---
> **Women's Suffrage (Primaries):** Texas women win the right to vote in primaries. **Anglo-Texan** suffragists lead the charge, though Black and **Spanish-Texan** women still face significant barriers at the polls due to the poll tax.


# 1919
---
> **The Canales Investigation:** State Representative José T. Canales leads an investigation into the Texas Rangers, exposing widespread abuses and killings of Spanish-Texans along the border. The Rangers are subsequently downsized and professionalized.

# 1924
---
> **"Ma" Ferguson Elected:** Running against the Klan, Miriam "Ma" Ferguson becomes the first female governor of Texas. She represents a populist coalition of **Anglo-Texans** and **Spanish-Texans** weary of Klan violence.


# 1925
