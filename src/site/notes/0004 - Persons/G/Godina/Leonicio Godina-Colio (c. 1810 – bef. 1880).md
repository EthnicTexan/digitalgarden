# Leonicio Godina-Colio (c. 1810 – bef. 1880)

---

**Leonicio Godina-Colio** (often recorded as **Dionisio**, **Ilion**, **Godino** or **Guadina**) was a Mexican-born wagoner and settler in South Texas. His life in the San Antonio and Wilson County areas is documented through a trail of records marked by frequent phonetic misspellings, reflecting the linguistic shifts of the mid-19th-century Texas frontier.

### Address/ Location - 

## 1859 - Arrival and Family Life in San Antonio

---

### Location: San Fernando Cathedral, San Antonio, Texas

By the late 1850s, Leonicio was established in San Antonio with his partner, **Florencia Treviño**. Although they did not formally marry in Texas until 1871, church records confirm they were raising a family together as early as 1859. NOTE: I am actively searching to see if they were married in Mexico before coming to Texas possibly around 1854/1855. #willcircleback
