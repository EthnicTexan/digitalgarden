Census records from this period show Francisco transitioning from a merchant to a widower raising his children in a more modest environment.

- **1804:** Listed as a **Merchant** with a wife and four children.
    
- **May 15, 1807:** His wife, **Petra Sandoval**, passed away at age 30.

Francisco lived through the bloodiest era in Texas history: the **Gutiérrez–Magee Expedition** and the subsequent Spanish Retribution (Battle of Medina).

- **Second Marriage:** In the aftermath of the 1813 Spanish takeover, Francisco married **Antonia Hernandez**, who was classified as a **_Mulata_**.
    
- **Political Context:** The fact that Francisco was spared during the 1813 executions suggests he may have remained loyal to the Spanish Crown (Royalists) or had enough social standing via his Urrutia/Sandoval connections to survive the purge of rebels.
