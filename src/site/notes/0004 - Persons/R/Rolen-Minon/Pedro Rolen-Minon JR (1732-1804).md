# Pedro Rolén Miñón (c. 1732 – aft. 1804)

---

**Pedro Rolén Miñón** (born **Pierre Roland Minon**) was a French-born soldier who became a notable figure in the Spanish Borderlands of Texas. His life spanned three empires—France, Louisiana, and New Spain—and was defined by his transition from a French deserter to a disabled Spanish _soldado de cuera_ (leather-jacket soldier) in San Antonio de Béxar.

Pedro re-enlisted in the Spanish military at the San Marcos Presidio before moving to the remote and dangerous **San Sabá** outpost.

- **The Cannon Accident:** During active combat against "The Enemy" (likely the 1758/1759 Comanche-Wichita conflicts), Pedro was devastated by an artillery accident.
    
- **The Injury:** A cannon "took one of my arms" and severely injured both of his legs.
    
- **Historical Insight:** Since his enemies (the _Norteños_) did not use artillery, this was likely a **malfunction or friendly fire incident** involving a Spanish field piece.

## 1768 - Appointment as "Inválido"

---

### Location - San Antonio de Béxar

On **May 10, 1768**, the Viceroy of New Spain, the **Marqués de Croix**, officially recognized Pedro’s sacrifice.

- **Pension:** He was granted **8 pesos per month** for life.
    
- **Continued Duty:** Despite being an amputee with leg injuries, Pedro continued to serve as an artilleryman in a limited capacity, likely supervising the maintenance of the Béxar cannons.
    

## 1769 - Royal Land Grant

---

### Location - San Antonio, Texas

Pedro was awarded a _merced_ (grant) by the Crown.

- **The Property:** He occupied a town lot with a **_jacal_** (a hut made of mud and sticks).
    
- **Legal Status:** Interestingly, he never possessed a formal deed to the land, living there through the permission of the _Ayuntamiento_ (City Council).

Within a span of three months, Pedro lost both his wife and his infant daughter.

- **March 23, 1771:** His wife, **Antonia Caymusques**, died following an "accidental" event. She was buried at San Fernando.
    
- **June 20, 1771:** His three-month-old daughter, **[[0004 - Persons/R/Rolen-Minon/Maria de la Encarnacion Rita Dolores Rolen-Minon\|Maria de la Encarnacion Rita Dolores Rolen-Minon]]**, passed away.
    

> **Caste Note:** In these burial records, the infant is classified as a **_Coyota_**. Because Pedro was a foreigner (French), the Spanish caste system categorized his children based on the mother’s _Mestiza_ status and his "classless" status as an immigrant.

## 1772–1792 - Later Life & Second Marriage

---

### Location - San Antonio de Béxar

Pedro married **Manuela (Maria) Salinas** sometime after 1771. They reportedly had no children together.

- **1792 Testimony:** At age 60, Pedro provided a full biography to the Governor. He noted he was illiterate and had to have someone sign for him.
    
- **The Legacy of San Sabá:** He showed the original 1768 pension order to the authorities to prove his lifelong service.
    

## 1795 - The Desperation Report

---

### Location - San Antonio - Plaza de Armas

A report dated **February 26, 1795**, captures a dark moment in Pedro’s final years.

- **Suicidal Threat:** Pedro told the guards that if he wasn't given a proper salary increase, he would "place himself at the muzzle of a cannon and fire it at himself."
    
- **The Message:** He warned his superiors to "take good care of the cannons," implying his deep psychological attachment to the artillery that had maimed him decades earlier.
    

## 1803–1804 - Final Census Records

---

### Location - Presidio de Béxar

Pedro appears in the military census records as an **Invalid**.

- **1803 Census:** Listed with wife [[0004 - Persons/S/Salinas/Maria Manuela Salinas\|Maria Manuela Salinas]] (age 60) and a "son of 13 years."
    
- **1804 Census:** Listed as married to [[Maria Manuela Salinas \|Maria Manuela Salinas ]]with a "son 14 years old."
    
- **The Mystery:** As his first wife died in 1771 and he claimed no children with his second wife, this "son" may have been a grandson (the child of his son Francisco) or a ward of the family.
