### **Genealogical Summary**

María Ana Petra represents the deep integration of the Urrutia lineage into the civilian fabric of San Antonio. By the late 18th century, the descendants of the original military "Captains" were marrying into established families like the Sandovals and Rolens, creating a complex web of kinship centered around the San Fernando Cathedral.
