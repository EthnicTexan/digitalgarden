## 1692  - Expedition
---

- **August 1692: First Apache Campaign** While stationed at the Neches River garrison as a young soldier, Urrutia participates in a joint military expedition with the **"Texas" (Hasinai)** Indians. The group marches westward into Apache territory.
    
- **The Night Ambush:** During the expedition, the company is surprised by a night attack while sleeping. According to [[0004 - Persons/H/Father Francisco Hidalgo\|Father Francisco Hidalgo]], the group is saved from total destruction only by the **firearms** of the Spanish soldiers, including Urrutia. This marks one of Urrutia's earliest recorded encounters with the Apache nation.
    
- **c. late 1692: Major Military Victory:** Urrutia continues to serve in Spanish-Indian coalition forces. In a subsequent campaign during this period, the alliance achieves a decisive victory, reportedly **killing 136 Apaches**.

## 1694 - Expedition
---
- 1694: Conflicting Accounts of the "Desertion"
	- Evidence from the writings of [[0004 - Persons/M/Father Damián Massanet\|Father Damián Massanet]] suggests that after the Spanish withdrawal in 1693, Urrutia and other soldiers may have returned to the abandoned missions. A "faithful Indian" reported to the Padres that the deserters had gone back to help local tribes recover buried mission supplies and tools.
    
- 1694–1700: Life Among the Cantona Tribes

	- While it was previously believed Urrutia lived with the "Texas" (Hasinai) tribes, historian Herbert E. Bolton clarifies that he actually lived among the Cantona Indians near the lower Colorado (San Marcos) River.
    
    - **The Tribes:** He integrated specifically with the **Cantujuanas, Toos, and Yemes** (also recorded as Kanohatinos, Tohos, and Xarames).
        
    - **Cultural Mastery:** During these seven years, he became intimately acquainted with their customs and mastered their various languages, knowledge that would later make him the Spanish government’s most valuable asset in the region.
        
- c. 1695–1700: Rise to "Captain General"

	- Urrutia’s Spanish military training led to his appointment as the "Captain General" of a massive alliance of tribes located east of the middle Colorado River.
    
    - **Commanding the Coalition:** He claimed to have led joint campaigns involving as many as **10,000 to 12,000 warriors**.
        
    - **The Apache Conflict:** He served as the primary strategist for these allied nations in their "inveterate" (long-standing) war against the **Apaches**, their common enemy.
