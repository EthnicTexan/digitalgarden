# Joseph de Urrutia (1678-1740)
---

## 1678  - BIRTH 
Joseph was born in Spain in the year 1678
### Address/ Location - Guipúzcoa, Spain


## 1690 - Expedition
Joseph came to America before 1691 and was a member of the [Domingo Terán de los Ríos](https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/teran-de-los-rios-domingo) expedition


## 1692  - Expedition
- **August 1692: First Apache Campaign** While stationed at the Neches River garrison as a young soldier, Urrutia participates in a joint military expedition with the **"Texas" (Hasinai)** Indians. The group marches westward into Apache territory.
    
- **The Night Ambush:** During the expedition, the company is surprised by a night attack while sleeping. According to [[0004 - Persons/H/Father Francisco Hidalgo\|Father Francisco Hidalgo]], the group is saved from total destruction only by the **firearms** of the Spanish soldiers, including Urrutia. This marks one of Urrutia's earliest recorded encounters with the Apache nation.
    
- **c. late 1692: Major Military Victory:** Urrutia continues to serve in Spanish-Indian coalition forces. In a subsequent campaign during this period, the alliance achieves a decisive victory, reportedly **killing 136 Apaches**.

- **Significance:** These early successes establish Urrutia’s reputation as a capable warrior among the local tribes, laying the groundwork for his later appointment as their "Captain General" during his seven-year stay (1693–1700).

## 1693 - Expedition
### Colorado River, Texas 
- **Arrival and Abandonment:** Urrutia was a young soldier stationed at a Spanish garrison near the **Neches River** during the Terán expedition.
    
- **The 1693 Departure:** When Spanish forces withdrew from the area in 1693, Urrutia did not return with them. He remained in East Texas as one of only four soldiers left behind.

- He suffered an **accident on the Colorado River** which forced him to stay among the Indigenous populations.

- **Integration and Leadership:** He lived among the **Kanohatinos, Tohos, and Xarames** for seven years. During this time, he rose to the rank of **"Captain General"** for a confederation of tribes.
    
- **Military Campaigns:** Utilizing his Spanish military background, he led these nations in several extensive and successful campaigns against their common enemy, the **Apaches**.

This period marks the most legendary chapter of Joseph de Urrutia’s life—his transition from a Spanish soldier to a powerful leader among the Indigenous nations of the Texas coastal plains.

## 1694 - Expedition
- 1694: Conflicting Accounts of the "Desertion"
	- Evidence from the writings of [[0004 - Persons/M/Father Damián Massanet\|Father Damián Massanet]] suggests that after the Spanish withdrawal in 1693, Urrutia and other soldiers may have returned to the abandoned missions. A "faithful Indian" reported to the Padres that the deserters had gone back to help local tribes recover buried mission supplies and tools.
    
- 1694–1700: Life Among the Cantona Tribes

	- While it was previously believed Urrutia lived with the "Texas" (Hasinai) tribes, historian Herbert E. Bolton clarifies that he actually lived among the Cantona Indians near the lower Colorado (San Marcos) River.
    
    - **The Tribes:** He integrated specifically with the **Cantujuanas, Toos, and Yemes** (also recorded as Kanohatinos, Tohos, and Xarames).
        
    - **Cultural Mastery:** During these seven years, he became intimately acquainted with their customs and mastered their various languages, knowledge that would later make him the Spanish government’s most valuable asset in the region.
        
- c. 1695–1700: Rise to "Captain General"

	- Urrutia’s Spanish military training led to his appointment as the "Captain General" of a massive alliance of tribes located east of the middle Colorado River.
    
    - **Commanding the Coalition:** He claimed to have led joint campaigns involving as many as **10,000 to 12,000 warriors**.
        
    - **The Apache Conflict:** He served as the primary strategist for these allied nations in their "inveterate" (long-standing) war against the **Apaches**, their common enemy.

## 1698 - BIRTH - Child: [[0004 - Persons/U/Antonia de Urrutia-Ramon\|Antonia de Urrutia-Ramon]]


## 1700 - Return from Expedition
### Location - San Juan Bautista Mission 

The timeline of Joseph de Urrutia's "seven years" among the Indians is up for debate. 

- **Reconciliation of the "Seven Years" (1691–1697):**
    
    - **Departure:** Urrutia departed Monclova with the Terán Expedition on May 16, 1691.
        
    - **The Abandonment:** He remained in East Texas when the soldiers withdrew in 1693.
        
    - **The Duration:** If he married in Monclova in January 1697, his actual time in the Texas wilderness was approximately **six years** (1691–1697), rather than the seven years traditionally cited in his 1738 statement.
        
- **The 1700 Return to Service:**
    
    - **Rejoining the Spanish:** While he was already back in Mexico by 1697 for his wedding, historical accounts state he formally "rejoined his countrymen" in a military capacity shortly after the founding of **San Juan Bautista Mission** in 1700.
    
    - **Strategic Placement:** This mission was located on the Rio Grande, serving as the gateway back into the Texas territory he had previously lived in for years.

- **Lasting Indigenous Influence:** Even years after his departure, Urrutia and [[0004 - Persons/H/Father Francisco Hidalgo\|Father Francisco Hidalgo]] remained deeply respected by the **Asinais (Hasinai)** people.
- **The St. Denis Encounter:** When the French explorer **[[0004 - Persons/S/Louis Juchereau de St. Denis\|Louis Juchereau de St. Denis]]** arrived among the Asinais in 1714, the tribe used his expedition as a diplomatic channel to reach Spanish authorities.
- **A Specific Request for Leadership:** The Asinais requested that St. Denis petition the Mexican government to send two specific men back to them:
    - **Father Francisco Hidalgo:** To serve as their minister and missionary.
    - **"Captain Urrutia":** Specifically requested because of the years he spent living among them, his mastery of their **language**, and his intimate knowledge of their **customs**.
- **Coinciding Service:** This record confirms that Urrutia’s legendary stay in the Texas wilderness was contemporary with Father Hidalgo’s early missionary efforts in the same region.

## 1715 - Authority and the "Gran Quivira" Proposal

- **Recognition as an Expert:** Following his return from his "seven years" in the wilderness, Urrutia was recognized in Mexico as the leading authority on the indigenous peoples of Texas.
    
- **Administrative Appointment:** He was officially appointed as the **"Protector of the Indians"** in Nuevo León.
    
- **The Aguayo Connection:** Urrutia earned the trust of the powerful **[[0004 - Persons/A/Marquis of San Miguel de Aguayo\|Marquis of San Miguel de Aguayo]]**, who described him as a "man of much honor" from Guipúzcoa.
    
- **The Gran Quivira Expedition:** Aguayo recommended that Urrutia lead an expedition to discover the legendary **"Gran Quivira"**.
	- **Urrutia’s Confidence:** He asserted that he could successfully reach Quivira with only 10 or 12 men, relying entirely on the goodwill and protection of the many nations that remained his friends.
	- **Desire to Return:** Writing from the [[0009 - Places/M/Mines of Mazapil\|Mines of Mazapil]], Aguayo noted that even after an absence of nearly twenty years, Urrutia still "anxiously desires" to return to his indigenous allies.
- **Legacy of the Apache Conflict:** The early decision by Spaniards like Urrutia to aid the "Texas" (Hasinai) tribes permanently marked the Spanish as enemies of the **Apaches**. This "Apache terror" would go on to overshadow the entire history of Spanish Texas and the founding of San Antonio.

**Historical Note:** The mention of Urrutia serving at the **Mines of Mazapil** without cost to the Royal Treasury demonstrates his high social standing and personal wealth during this period.

## 1726 - The Calm Before the Conflict (1726–1730)

This entry documents a brief period of regional stability during the years preceding Joseph de Urrutia's appointment as Captain in San Antonio.


- **A Period of Relative Quiet:** Between 1726 and 1730, historical documents indicate a significant lull in hostilities committed by the Apaches.
- **Historical Context:** This temporary peace occurred while Urrutia was still serving in northern Mexico, prior to his 1733 arrival in San Antonio.
- **Presidio Life:** During these years, the lack of recorded conflict suggests that the missions and the Presidio de San Antonio de Béjar experienced a rare window of security before the "Apache terror" intensified again in the 1730s.

## 1732 - The Appointment to Captaincy (1732–1733)
### Location: San Antonio, Texas
- **The Governor’s Campaign:** In 1732, the Governor launched a formal military campaign against the Apaches.
- **The Failed Peace:** This campaign resulted in a superficial "peace". Under the guise of this treaty, Apache groups entered San Antonio—which was geographically exposed and near their territories—to commit outrages and instill panic among the residents.
- **Loss of Trust:** These events proved to the inhabitants of San Antonio that Apache diplomatic promises could not be trusted.
- **Call for Relief:** Following urgent petitions from the Governor for better security, the central government initiated measures to protect the settlement.
- **Urrutia Named Captain:** As a primary security measure, **Don Joseph de Urrutia** was appointed **Captain of the Presidio of Béjar**.
- **Reason for Selection:** He was specifically chosen for this prestigious command because of his "long experience" and unique history living among the various Indian nations.

## 1733 - Captaincy of San Antonio
This period marks the pinnacle of Joseph de Urrutia’s career, as he was formally recognized as the crown's most vital asset for the survival of San Antonio.

**July 4, 1733: Observations on Tribal Alliances**
In a letter written weeks before his official appointment, Urrutia noted a significant shift in frontier politics. He expressed surprise that the **Jumanes** had joined his enemies, the **Apaches**, noting that during his time living among them (1693–1700), these groups were "declared enemies".

**July 18, 1733: The Recommendation for Command**
Following a failed peace treaty and the murder of Spanish soldiers, **Don [[0004 - Persons/O/Juan de Olivan Rebolledo\|Juan de Olivan Rebolledo]] formally recommended Urrutia for the command of the Presidio of San Antonio.

**Justification:** The recommendation was based on Urrutia's "seven years" of immersion with tribes hostile to the Apaches and his status as the best-informed Spaniard on Indian affairs, with **40 years of service** across Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Texas.

**July 23, 1733: Formal Appointment as Captain**
By official decree, Joseph de Urrutia was ordered to take immediate possession of the **Presidio of San Antonio de Béjar**.
**Mission:** His primary charge was to leverage his old alliances with indigenous tribes to form a united front against the Apaches.
**Military Reinforcements:** Under his command, the garrison was increased by 25 men—drawn from the presidios of La Bahía and Los Adaes—to protect the *Villa* of San Fernando and the local missions from "relentless" Apache harassment.

## 1734 - The Apache Terror (1734–1738)

Between 1734 and 1738, Joseph de Urrutia's tenure as Captain of the Presidio de Béxar was defined by the relentless "Apache terror" that dictated the daily lives of San Antonio's settlers.


- **Daily Life and Constant Vigilance:** From 1734 to 1738, the history of San Antonio was a grim succession of Indian raids and murders, making the Apaches the most prominent concern for everyday citizens.
    
- **Signal Firearm Protocols:** To prevent false alarms, the Governor issued strict orders that no citizen of Béxar could discharge a firearm unless they witnessed Indians entering the settlement; a single shot served as the formal signal of an attack.
    
- **Urrutia’s Enforcement:** Carrying out these orders, Captain Joseph de Urrutia mandated that any citizen needing to fire a gun for cleaning purposes must first obtain an official license from the captain of the guard.
    
- **Confirmed Service Record:** On November 13, 1734, official records noted that Captain Commander Jose de Urrutia had served the Spanish crown for over 40 years with the full approval of the authorities.
    
- **The "Red Hair" Conspiracy:** Urrutia reported a major rumored plot involving the influential Apache chief **[[0004 - Persons/C/Cabellos Colorados\|Cabellos Colorados]]** (Red Hair). Before his imprisonment, the chief allegedly conspired with the "Capitán Grande" of the Apache tribes to steal all horses from the presidios of Béxar, Río Grande, Coahuila, and Sacramento, followed by a total slaughter of the inhabitants.
    
- **Period of Quiet (1737–1738):** During the imprisonment of Cabellos Colorados and his band (December 1737 to September 1738), San Antonio experienced a rare period of peace with no recorded Apache depredations.
    
- **Formal Investigation:** Governor Orobio Bazterra eventually launched an investigation into Cabellos Colorados' actions to provide the Viceroy with evidence of Apache bad faith and to secure further relief for the people of Béxar.

## 1735 - Military Administration & Legal Conflict (1735)

The year 1735 reveals the complex administrative and financial responsibilities Joseph de Urrutia held as Captain of the Presidio de Béxar. Records document a significant legal dispute over military logistics and his role as a financial intermediary for his soldiers.

- **April – June 1735: The Reimbursement Dispute (_Urrutia vs. Costales_)** Joseph de Urrutia entered into a protracted legal battle with **[[0004 - Persons/C/Gabriel Costales\|Gabriel Costales]]**, Captain of the Presidio of La Bahía, concerning expenses for a squadron of La Bahía soldiers stationed at Béxar.
    
    - **Authorization of Supplies:** Acting on an order from Governor [[0004 - Persons/S/Manuel de Sandoval\|Manuel de Sandoval]], Urrutia had provided horses, arms, and provisions to the La Bahía soldiers to ensure the "royal service" was not interrupted.
        
    - **The Detailed Ledger:** Urrutia presented meticulous notebooks documenting items furnished to the soldiers, including corn, piloncillo (sugar), soap, tobacco, salt, shoes, and horses.
        
    - **Accusations of Profiteering:** Captain Costales contested the bill (totaling 1,048 pesos), accusing Urrutia of greed and charging excessive prices—specifically for horses and corn—claiming Urrutia was seeking "ambitious purpose and harm [to] my interests".
        
    - **Urrutia’s Health and Appeal:** During the proceedings, Urrutia was notably confined to his bed due to illness ("I am in bed, as everybody knows"). Lacking legal counsel, he eventually recused the Governor’s local judgment and appealed the case to the **Superior Government of the Viceroy** in Mexico City.
        
- **September 1735: Power of Attorney and Financial Oversight** Urrutia’s influence extended into the personal finances of his garrison.
    
    - **Salary Collection:** Several soldiers granted Urrutia (or his associate [[0004 - Persons/A/Juan de Angulo\|Juan de Angulo]]) power of attorney to collect their annual salaries directly from the royal treasury.
        
    - **Tax Application:** A portion of these collected salaries was used to pay Urrutia’s own taxes, demonstrating a high level of financial entanglement between the Captain and his men.
        
#### Genealogical Insights & Household Details

- **Family References:** In 1734, Governor Sandoval sent "affectionate regards" to Urrutia’s wife, **Doña Juana**.
    
- **Domestic Goods:** The military ledgers of 1735 show that Urrutia was supplying not just military gear, but also domestic items such as **"woman's shoes"** for the soldiers' wives, highlighting the presence of families within the presidio community.

## 1737 - Captivity of Cabellos Colorados (1737)
---

The imprisonment of the influential Lipan Apache chief **Cabellos Colorados** (Red Hair) in late 1737 brought a temporary and significant peace to San Antonio, while highlighting Joseph de Urrutia’s role in uncovering frontier conspiracies.


**December 11, 1737: Capture of the Chief**
* Following years of raids, Spanish forces captured the Lipan Apache chief **Cabellos Colorados** at [[0009 - Places/C/El Chapintillo\|El Chapintillo]], located approximately 30 miles from San Antonio.
* The chief and his band were brought to the **Presidio de Béxar** as prisoners.


 **Discovery of a Frontier Conspiracy**
* Captain Joseph de Urrutia reported a chilling rumor regarding the chief's plans prior to his capture.
* According to Urrutia, Cabellos Colorados had allegedly conspired with the "Capitán Grande" of the Apache tribes to orchestrate a massive, synchronized strike.
* The plot involved stealing all horses from the presidios of **Béxar, Río Grande, Coahuila, and Sacramento**, followed by a systematic slaughter of the regional inhabitants.


**The Period of "Forced Peace"**
* From December 1737 through September 1738, while the chief was held at the presidio, Apache depredations at Béxar ceased entirely.
* This lull in violence confirmed the chief's immense reputation and influence over his people.


 **Governor’s Formal Investigation**
* **Governor [[0004 - Persons/O/Prudencio de Orobio y Basterra\|Prudencio de Orobio y Basterra]]** initiated a formal investigation into the crimes committed by Cabellos Colorados.
* Evidence of "Apache bad faith" was meticulously compiled to petition the Viceroy for permanent relief and defensive reinforcements for the San Antonio settlers.

* This document allowed Jordán to act as Urrutia's legal representative in official matters, likely facilitating the collection of salaries or the resolution of the various lawsuits (such as *Urrutia vs. Costales* or *Rodríguez vs. Urrutia*) that marked this period.


* **Chronological Alignment**
* This legal delegation occurred just months before the capture of Chief **Cabellos Colorados** in December 1737, a period during which Urrutia was managing intense frontier hostilities alongside his administrative duties.
* The use of a formal representative suggests that Urrutia’s responsibilities at the Presidio—and perhaps his recurring health issues noted in 1735—necessitated professional assistance for his business in Mexico City or other provinces.
