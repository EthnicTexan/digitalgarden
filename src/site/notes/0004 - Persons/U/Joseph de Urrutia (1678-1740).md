# Joseph de Urrutia (1678-1740)
---

## 1678  - BIRTH 
Joseph was born in Spain in the year 1678
### Address/ Location - Guipúzcoa, Spain


## 1690 - Expedition
Joseph came to America before 1691 and was a member of the [Domingo Terán de los Ríos](https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/teran-de-los-rios-domingo) expedition


## 1692  - Expedition
- **August 1692: First Apache Campaign** While stationed at the Neches River garrison as a young soldier, Urrutia participates in a joint military expedition with the **"Texas" (Hasinai)** Indians. The group marches westward into Apache territory.
    
- **The Night Ambush:** During the expedition, the company is surprised by a night attack while sleeping. According to [[0004 - Persons/H/Father Francisco Hidalgo\|Father Francisco Hidalgo]], the group is saved from total destruction only by the **firearms** of the Spanish soldiers, including Urrutia. This marks one of Urrutia's earliest recorded encounters with the Apache nation.
    
- **c. late 1692: Major Military Victory:** Urrutia continues to serve in Spanish-Indian coalition forces. In a subsequent campaign during this period, the alliance achieves a decisive victory, reportedly **killing 136 Apaches**.

- **Significance:** These early successes establish Urrutia’s reputation as a capable warrior among the local tribes, laying the groundwork for his later appointment as their "Captain General" during his seven-year stay (1693–1700).

## 1693 - Expedition
### Colorado River, Texas 
- **Arrival and Abandonment:** Urrutia was a young soldier stationed at a Spanish garrison near the **Neches River** during the Terán expedition.
    
- **The 1693 Departure:** When Spanish forces withdrew from the area in 1693, Urrutia did not return with them. He remained in East Texas as one of only four soldiers left behind.

- He suffered an **accident on the Colorado River** which forced him to stay among the Indigenous populations.

- **Integration and Leadership:** He lived among the **Kanohatinos, Tohos, and Xarames** for seven years. During this time, he rose to the rank of **"Captain General"** for a confederation of tribes.

This period marks the most legendary chapter of Joseph de Urrutia’s life—his transition from a Spanish soldier to a powerful leader among the Indigenous nations of the Texas coastal plains.

## 1694 - Expedition
- 1694: Conflicting Accounts of the "Desertion"
	- Evidence from the writings of [[0004 - Persons/M/Father Damián Massanet\|Father Damián Massanet]] suggests that after the Spanish withdrawal in 1693, Urrutia and other soldiers may have returned to the abandoned missions. A "faithful Indian" reported to the Padres that the deserters had gone back to help local tribes recover buried mission supplies and tools.
    
- 1694–1700: Life Among the Cantona Tribes

	- While it was previously believed Urrutia lived with the "Texas" (Hasinai) tribes, historian Herbert E. Bolton clarifies that he actually lived among the Cantona Indians near the lower Colorado (San Marcos) River.
    
    - **The Tribes:** He integrated specifically with the **Cantujuanas, Toos, and Yemes** (also recorded as Kanohatinos, Tohos, and Xarames).
        
    - **Cultural Mastery:** During these seven years, he became intimately acquainted with their customs and mastered their various languages, knowledge that would later make him the Spanish government’s most valuable asset in the region.
        
- c. 1695–1700: Rise to "Captain General"

	- Urrutia’s Spanish military training led to his appointment as the "Captain General" of a massive alliance of tribes located east of the middle Colorado River.
    
    - **Commanding the Coalition:** He claimed to have led joint campaigns involving as many as **10,000 to 12,000 warriors**.
        
    - **The Apache Conflict:** He served as the primary strategist for these allied nations in their "inveterate" (long-standing) war against the **Apaches**, their common enemy.

## 1700 - Return from Expedition
### Location - San Juan Bautista Mission 

The timeline of Joseph de Urrutia's "seven years" among the Indians is up for debate. 

- **Reconciliation of the "Seven Years" (1691–1697):**
    
    - **Departure:** Urrutia departed Monclova with the Terán Expedition on May 16, 1691.
        
    - **The Abandonment:** He remained in East Texas when the soldiers withdrew in 1693.
        
    - **The Duration:** If he married in Monclova in January 1697, his actual time in the Texas wilderness was approximately **six years** (1691–1697), rather than the seven years traditionally cited in his 1738 statement.
        
- **The 1700 Return to Service:**
    
    - **Rejoining the Spanish:** While he was already back in Mexico by 1697 for his wedding, historical accounts state he formally "rejoined his countrymen" in a military capacity shortly after the founding of **San Juan Bautista Mission** in 1700.
    
    - **Strategic Placement:** This mission was located on the Rio Grande, serving as the gateway back into the Texas territory he had previously lived in for years.

- **The St. Denis Encounter:** When the French explorer **[[0004 - Persons/S/Louis Juchereau de St. Denis\|Louis Juchereau de St. Denis]]** arrived among the Asinais in 1714, the tribe used his expedition as a diplomatic channel to reach Spanish authorities.

    - **Father Francisco Hidalgo:** To serve as their minister and missionary.
    - **"Captain Urrutia":** Specifically requested because of the years he spent living among them, his mastery of their **language**, and his intimate knowledge of their **customs**.
- **Coinciding Service:** This record confirms that Urrutia’s legendary stay in the Texas wilderness was contemporary with Father Hidalgo’s early missionary efforts in the same region.
