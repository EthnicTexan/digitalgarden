Welcome to Ethnic Texan! While we love sharing the Texan heritage, we believe that privacy is just as important as history. Our motto is: **"Document the dead, but protect the living."**

Here is how we keep our fellow Texans data safe:

- **Living People are Private:** If a person was born after **1925**, we assume they are living. Their profiles are hidden or anonymized unless they have given us permission to share their details.
- **No Personal Data:** We do not publish sensitive information such as Social Security Numbers (for anyone) or full birth dates for the living.
- **Photo Etiquette:** We love old photos, but we will not post pictures of living relatives without asking them first.
- **Sensitive Sources:** Occasionally, a public document might mention a living person. In these cases, we mention the document existed but keep the personal details confidential.

**See something you want removed?** If you are a relative and would like your information (or a family member's information) taken down or modified, please let us know immediately at: EthnicTexan@gmail.com
